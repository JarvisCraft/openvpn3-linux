SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-admin log-service`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-admin log-service`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
This manages a few adjustable knobs available in the ``openvpn3-service-log``
when run as a D-Bus service.  The access control for this command is managed in
the D-Bus policy, which by default is only allowed for the *root* and
*@OPENVPN_USERNAME@* user accounts.


OPTIONS
=======

-h, --help      Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--config-show
                Shows the contents of the configuration file used by
                ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8).

--config-set
                Modifies a configuration setting in the configuration file.
                Changing the configuration file will require the
                ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) process to be restarted before
                they become active.  This option requires two arguments:
                *CONFIG-NAME* and *CONFIG-VALUE*.  Valid *CONFIG-NAMEs* are:

                :code:`log-file`
                        Sets the log destination for log events.  See the
                        ``--log-file`` option in the man page to
                        ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) for details.

                        This cannot be set if ``journald`` or ``syslog`` has
                        been set.

                :code:`colour`
                        Enables using  colours in logged lines when logging to
                        file.  This can only be used when a log file
                        configured.

                :code:`idle-exit`
                        Sets the automatic idle shut down time-out.  See the
                        ``--idle-exit`` option in the man page for
                        ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) for details.

                :code:`journald`
                        Configures ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) to send
                        log events to the ``systemd-journald``\(8) service.
                        See the ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) man page for
                        more details.

                        This option cannot be combined with ``syslog``,
                        ``log-file`` or ``colour``.

                :code:`syslog`
                        Configures ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8) to send
                        log events to the locally running syslog service.

                        This option cannot be combined with ``journald``,
                        ``log-file`` or ``colour``.

                :code:`syslog-facility`
                        Configures which syslog facility to use when logging
                        via syslog.  Default is `LOG_DAEMON`.  This has only
                        effect when logging via ``syslog`` has been enabled.

--config-unset
                Similar to ``--config-set`` but removes a setting from the
                configuration file.

--log-level LEVEL
                Sets the system wide log verbosity for the log events being
                logged to file or any other log destination
                ``openvpn3-service-log`` is configured to use.  Valid values
                are :code:`0` to :code:`6`.  The higher value, the more verbose the log
                events will be.  Log level :code:`6` will contain all debug events.

--timestamp BOOL
                Some of the log destinations supported by
                ``openvpn3-service-log`` may allow one to log with or without
                timestamps.  This option enables or disables timestamps attached
                to log events.  Valid arguments: :code:`true`, :code:`false`.

--dbus-details BOOL
                Each log event contains some more detailed meta-data of the
                sender of the log event.  This is disabled by default, but when
                enabled it will add a line on the log destination
                before the log event itself with this meta-data.  This is mostly
                only useful when debugging and not recommended for normal
                production.  Valid arguments: :code:`true`, :code:`false`

--enable-log-prefix BOOL
                This setting is only available if ``openvpn3-service-log``\(8)
                is configured to use ``journald``.  If enabled, each log line
                (`MESSAGE=`) in the journal will be prefixed with a log tag.
                The log tag is always logged as a journald meta data variable
                (`O3_LOGTAG`).  See ``journalctl``\(1) and the ``--output`` and
                ``--output-fields`` options for details.  Valid arguments:
                :code:`true`, :code:`false`.

--list-subscriptions
                Lists all the services the log service has subscribed to.
