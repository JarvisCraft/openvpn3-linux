:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux

SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-admin init-config`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-admin init-config`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
This is a configuration helper command, which will attempt to auto-detect
features on the running system and configure OpenVPN 3 Linux accordingly.

The state directory used by the OpenVPN 3 Linux services will also have
the ownership and access adjusted to match the requirements.

For systems with SELinux available, it will also ensure the SELinux file
contexts of directories needed by OpenVPN 3 Linux services are correctly
labelled.

By default, this command will not write any configuration files to disk.
Only the state directory will be created if missing in addition to file and
directory access being properly setup.

When this command is instructed to write configuration files, it will
only do this if no configuration files are present.  If this command is
forced to write configuration files, it will only change settings needed
to be modified.  All other changes should be preserved.

*NOTE* This command must be run as `root`.
