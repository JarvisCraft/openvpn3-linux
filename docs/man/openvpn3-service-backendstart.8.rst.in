:Manual section: 8
:Manual group: OpenVPN 3 Linux

SYNOPSIS
========
| ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` ``[OPTIONS]``
| ``openvpn3-service-backendstart`` ``-h`` | ``--help``


DESCRIPTION
===========
This service is automatically started when the ``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr``
requests a new VPN tunnel to be initiated.  This service has the responsibility
to start the ``openvpn3-service-client`` process and provide enough information
to it so it can register itself against a session object in the
``openvpn3-service-sessionmgr`` service.

This service is normally started automatically when needed, via the
*net.openvpn.v3.backendstart.service* auto-start configuration by the
``dbus-daemon``\(1), but can also be started manually on the command line.
Beware that running this with another user account than
:code:`@OPENVPN_USERNAME@` also requires updating the D-Bus policy as well.


OPTIONS
=======
-h, --help
    Print  usage and help details to the terminal

--version
    Prints the version of the program and exists

--idle-exit SECONDS
    Defines how long this service should be running without any tasks to do.
    Default for openvpn3-service-backendstart is 3 seconds.  If set to 0,
    the idle detection is disabled.

--log-level LEVEL
    Sets the default log verbosity for log events generated by this service.
    The default is :code:`3`.  Valid values are :code:`0` to :code:`6`.
    Higher log levels results in more verbose logs and log level :code:`6`
    will contain all debug log events.

--client-log-level LEVEL
    This adds the ``--log-level`` option with the given argument when
    starting the ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.

--client-log-file FILE
    Save the log output to ``FILE``.  Alternatively, if the :code:`stdout:`
    keyword is used, the log output is sent to the current terminal.

--client-colour
    This adds the ``--colour`` option when starting the
    ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.

--client-disable-protect-socket
    This adds the ``--disable-protect-socket`` option when starting the
    ``openvpn3-service-client`` process.
