# @brief A stress tester of the session manager, client and netcfg
#        components in the OpenVPN 3 Linux stack.
#
#        This script will iterate 10000 times doing a connect,
#        ping the remote server and disconnect again.  The remote
#        server VPN IP address is expected to be 10.8.0.1.  See
#        the server and client example configuration files for
#        more information.
#
#        If any of the openvpn3 commands or ping fails, the script
#        is expected to exit instantly.  stderr is also redirected
#        to stdout to simplify catching all the logs by a callers
#        of this script.
